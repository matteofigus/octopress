<h2>We&rsquo;re going (more) global</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re at the start of something exciting at OpenTable.</p>

<p>We are the leading restaurant reservation system and as a tech team we are responsible for building first class systems for our restaurants and our consumers, who use our website and mobile apps to make and manage reservations.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been operating in a handfull of countries (United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Canada and Mexico) for a while now and the time is right for us to expand into lots of new countries.</p>

<p>We want to provide an experience that makes restaurant reservations easy wherever you are in the world.</p>

<p>This is an incredibly exciting opportunity for us as a tech team. Over the last couple of years we&rsquo;ve been working hard to re-architect our platform; the platform has evolved from a single monolithic codebase to a set of globalised microservices and sites. We achieved this by breaking our system up into small component verticals and growing small teams (a mixture of product, design and engineering) to take ownership of each vertical.</p>

<p>We are building new sytems to scale and launch disruptive products in new markets all over the world.</p>

<h3>How we work</h3>

<p>As we&rsquo;ve grown as a tech team, across San Francisco and London, we&rsquo;ve evolved how we work together and we have ambitious goals.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>We value small independent teams</strong> that take ownership of their feature/area, who care about what they do and who constantly strive to make things better. We&rsquo;re a big company but as teams we act small.</li>
<li><strong>We ship tested code early and often</strong>. We know that the way you reduce risk is to get code into production and rely on unit, integration and acceptance testing to provide confidence in our software.</li>
<li><strong>We open source software</strong> and we care about maintaining our OSS. Notably we&rsquo;ve released a feature toggle product called <a href="http://github.com/opentable/hobknob">Hobknob</a> and a web component framework called <a href="http://github.com/opentable/opencomponents">Open Components</a>. But check out the rest of the work we&rsquo;ve open sourced on <a href="http://github.com/Opentable">Github</a>.</li>
<li><strong>We value autonomy</strong> All engineers produce solutions NOT specs from architects. We also value 20% time where two days a sprint are spent working on whatever you want.</li>
<li><strong>We metric. We monitor. We log</strong> These are important to us. Each of our systems logs to our logging infrastructure (StatsD and Logstash) and we, as independant teams, build our own dashboards in Grafana and Kibana to visualise our metrics and logs. Our systems also use Nagios and PagerDuty to monitor and alert us of any issues.</li>
<li><strong>We&rsquo;re data driven</strong> New features are always A/B tested and we make decision based on the results of these tests, not on personal opinion or management-driven feature development.</li>
</ul>


<h3>What&rsquo;s next?</h3>

<p>Over the years we&rsquo;ve transitioned from a pure .NET stack to a more varied stack of languages and frameworks. We&rsquo;re not restrictive on language choice and more open to choosing the right language for the right solution. This has meant the introduction of Node.js and Java to our platform (and a couple of systems in other languages too), as well as many new systems in .NET on Mono. We&rsquo;re still big fans of .NET but we&rsquo;re not fans of Windows.</p>

<p>We want strong engineers to come and work with us, whatever their background. We value people who are excited by learning new things and who care about the right solution.</p>
