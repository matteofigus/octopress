<p>We&rsquo;re at the start of something exciting at Opentable. If you don&rsquo;t know who we are, Opentable is the world leading restaurant reservation system. As a tech team we are responsible for building first class systems for our restaurants and our consumers who use our website and mobile apps to make and manage reservations. We&rsquo;ve been operating in a handfull of countries (US, UK, Germany, Japan, Canada and Mexico) for a while now and now is the time for us to expand into lots of new countries. We want to provide an experience that makes restaurant reservations easy whereever you are in the world.</p>

<p>This is an incredibly exciting opportunity for us as a tech team. Over the last couple of years we&rsquo;ve been working hard to re-architect our platform. Our platform has evolved from a single monolithic codebase to a set of globalised microservices and sites. We achieved this by breaking our system up into small component verticals and growing small teams (a mixture of product, design and engineering) to take ownership of each vertical.</p>

<p>To scale our systems and launch disruptive products in new markets all over the world we need to build new systems to facilitate this.</p>

<h3>How we work</h3>

<p>As we&rsquo;ve grown as a tech team, across San Francisco and London, we&rsquo;ve evolved how we work together.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>We value small independant teams</strong> that take ownership of their feature/area, who care about what they do and who constantly strive to make things better.</li>
<li><strong>We ship tested code early and often</strong>. We know that the way you reduce risk is to get code into production and rely on unit, integration and acceptance testing to provide confidence in our software.</li>
<li><strong>We open source software</strong> and we care about maintaining our OSS. Notably we&rsquo;ve released a feature toggle product called <a href="http://github.com/opentable/hobknob">Hobknob</a> and a web component framework called <a href="http://github.com/opentable/opencomponents">Open Components</a>. But check out the rest of the work we&rsquo;ve open sourced on <a href="http://github.com/Opentable">Github</a>.</li>
<li><strong>We value autonomy</strong> All engineers produce solutions NOT specs from &ldquo;architects&rdquo;. We also value 20% time where 2 days a sprint are spent working on whatever you want.</li>
<li><strong>We metric. We monitor. We log</strong> These are important to us. Each of our systems logs to our logging infrastructure (StatsD and Logstash) and we, as independant teams, build our own dashboards in grafana and kibana to visualise our metrics and logs. Our systems also use Nagios and PagerDuty to monitor and alert us of any issues.</li>
<li><strong>We&rsquo;re data driven</strong> New features are always a/b tested and we make decision based on the results of these tests, not on anyones personal opinion or management driven feature development.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Who we&rsquo;re looking for</h3>

<p>Over the years we&rsquo;ve transitioned from a pure .NET stack to a more varied stack of languages and frameworks. We&rsquo;re less restrictive and more open to choosing the right language for the right solution. This has meant the introduction of Node.js and Java to our platform (and a couple of systems in other languages too), as well as many new systems in .NET on Mono. We&rsquo;re still big fans of .NET but we&rsquo;re not fans of Windows.</p>

<p>We want strong engineers to come work for us, regardless of language. Over the years we&rsquo;ve gained a lot of experience in working with Node.js and many of us had no previous exposure to Node (the majority of us being .NET engineers). We&rsquo;re looking for people who are excited by learning something new and who care about the right solution over the their personal preference of language.</p>

<h3>What we&rsquo;re doing</h3>

<ul>
<li>Multi-language platform</li>
<li>Focus on reducing time to market</li>
</ul>
